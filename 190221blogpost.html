    <h2>1. Start researching where you want to go early</h2>
    <p>
        Strategic applications medicine can be key to getting in. It is important to like the course, Uni and location but there is no point applying to a University where you will be cut off before they even get to see your application. Some places favour amazing UCAT scores, some outstanding GCSE results and others are very personal statement or non-academic information form orientated. By researching early, you will know the selection of Universities you can realistically choose from and help make your application as competitive as possible. It is also really helpful to look at what Universities offer widening access programmes, foundation years and graduate pathways into medicine.

    </p>
    <h2>2. Keep a reflective diary</h2>
    <p>
        Try and keep a diary not just keeping a track of what you are doing and when but of how it made you feel or things you learnt about medicine from it. Also donâ€™t just include virtual work experience and volunteering; any books you have read, podcasts you have listened to, information consumed from medical students and Doctors etc. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        It is really important to consider not just what draws you to medicine but also what the challenges are and how you might deal with those, this will also help demonstrate you have a realistic insight into the profession.
